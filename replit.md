## System Architecture

### Core Framework
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web application with professional trading interface styling
- **Backend**: Python-based modular architecture with specialized analysis engines
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance (yfinance) for Indian stock market data (NSE format)
- **ML Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models, scikit-learn for traditional ML
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts and technical analysis visualization

### Modular Design Philosophy
The system follows a microservices-inspired modular architecture where each component has a specific responsibility:
- Separation of concerns between data processing, analysis, prediction, and visualization
- Independent engines that can be updated or replaced without affecting other components
- Centralized configuration through the main Streamlit app

## Key Components

### 7. Visualization Engine (`visualization/chart_engine.py`)
- **Interactive candlestick charts**: Professional trading-style charts with Plotly
- **Technical overlay integration**: Indicators and patterns overlaid on price charts
- **Multi-timeframe visualization**: Charts for 5-minute, 15-minute, daily, and weekly views
- **Pattern highlighting**: Visual markers for detected patterns and signals

### 8. Report Generator (`reports/report_generator.py`)
- **Multi-format output**: Excel, PDF, JSON, and HTML reports
- **Professional formatting**: Styled reports with charts and tables
- **Automated report generation**: Comprehensive analysis summaries
- **Export capabilities**: Ready-to-share formatted reports

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Stock symbol input → Data pipeline fetches live market data from Yahoo Finance
2. **Data Processing**: Raw OHLCV data → Feature engineering → Multi-timeframe analysis
3. **Analysis Pipeline**: 
   - Technical analysis engine processes indicators and signals
   - Price action engine analyzes pure price movements
   - Pattern discovery engine identifies formations
   - Deep learning engine trains models and generates predictions
4. **Intelligence Generation**: All engines contribute to composite analysis and predictions
5. **Visualization**: Chart engine creates interactive visualizations
6. **Report Generation**: All analysis consolidated into professional reports
7. **User Interface**: Streamlit displays results with real-time updates
